          <h2>The History of Salt Lake City.</h2>
          <img
            src="images/historical_site_slc.jpg"
            alt="historical_photo"
            id="photo1"
          />
          <p>
            The founding of Salt Lake City dates back to 1847, when Brigham
            Young, a prophet, led a village of pioneers in an effort to escape
            the violence that plagued the American Midwest at that time. The
            Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is currently
            headquartered in SLC.
          </p>
          <p>
            The development and growth of Salt Lake City's economy began with
            the construction of the 1st Intercontinental Railroad, which gave
            the region the nickname "The Crossroads of the West". Furthermore,
            mining activity has always been very strong in the area. Another
            culminating factor in the development of SLC was the ski-based
            tourism industry, which brings thousands of people to the region
            each year.

          <h2>Demography</h2>
          <img

          <p>
            Salt Lake City is the capital of Utah, and is the most populous city
            in the state, with approximately 200,500 inhabitants. According to
            information from the US government, 78% of the city's population
            adheres to the Mormon religion. The county is 517 km away from
            Denver (approximately 8 hours drive), and borders North Salt Lake,
            South Salt Lake and Woods Cross.
          </p>
          <p>
            The median household income in Utah was $71,414.00, with South
            Jordan having the highest value in the state at $101,374.00 and
            Provo having the lowest value at $48,755.00, probably due to a
            significant portion of the population of the city being made up of
            university students. Income inequality in Utah is less extreme than
            in the country as a whole. Within the state, the most uneven
            distribution is recorded in Salt Lake City and the lowest in Lehi.
