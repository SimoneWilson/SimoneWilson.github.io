            <p> John Doe is a resident of Murray-UT and he loves to build new things. He is a
                construction worker and he is
                planning to replace a roof next week. He needs to know the weather forecast because it will be easier
                to work on the roof if it's sunny.

            <p> Mary Doe is a resident of Salt Lake City. She lives and works Downtown. She is an accountant for a Bank
                and she walks to work every morning. She loves to dress up and she hates feeling cold, so
                it's important for her to check the
                weather forecast every day before choosing her outfit. </p>
