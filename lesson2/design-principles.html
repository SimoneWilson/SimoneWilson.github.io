        <h3>Repetition</h3>
        <div>

        </div>

        <p>The principle of repetition is evident in this website. <a href="https://www.usps.com/">usps.com</a>
          This principle simply means the reusing of the same or like elements
          throughout the design. You can see that the site uses a uniform color
          scheme, the ux displays the white, the dark blue and the light gray.
          Also the links are repeatedly placed kind of like a checkerboard
          making the UI predictable and pleasant.</p>

        <h3>Hick's Law</h3>
        <div>

        </div>

        <p>It's possible to identify on the website <a href="https://www.familysearch.org/en/">familysearch.org</a>
          many different design principles, but the principle set by the
          Hick-Hyman Law is highlighted on this page. The reason
          that this follows the law is that there is only one choice of button
          to click. The principle of Hick's law states that the more choices a
          user has the longer it will take them to make a decision of what to
          click.
          By minimizing the number of links that can be clicked on this page, it
          will minimize the risk of the user getting confused about what to
          click to get to the next step in the page flow.</p>

        <h3>White Space and Clear Design</h3>
        <div>
          <img src="images/bananarepublic_reduced.png" alt="banana republic">

        </div>

        <p>The design principle that this page represents is white space and
          clean design. The webpage at
          <a href="https://bananarepublic.gap.com">https://bananarepublic.gap.com</a>
          follows that principle by having plenty of whitespace in between the
          different segments of the page and it's a clean design because there
          is only one image and not too many different colors that all fit with
          the logo.</p>
